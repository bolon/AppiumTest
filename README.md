# AppiumTest
Utilize Appium to automate test

Based on <a href="https://nishantverma.gitbooks.io/appium-for-android">this superb tutorial</a>

# Note to self
1. Make sure when launch device from Appium GUI to set the device name manually not from the dropdown.
2. Make sure the APK exist
3. (Optional) Set executable from Android SDK accessible from everywhere.
4. Check if something wrong using Appium-doctor.
5. UIAutomator already exist in Appium.

# Observation
<h2>Espresso vs Appium</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Espresso need the source code | Appium only needs the APK</li>
  <li>Espresso only on Android | Appium cross-platform and the test-suite can be reused across platform (not tested yet)</li>
</ol>

# Roadmap
1. Do complex integration testing
2. Reuse test code across platform
